 This project is being done for my Master's thesis, titled "Minecraft Social Agents".

 The goal is to create socially intelligent and player-looking NPCs. An NPC is socially intelligent if it can have social interactions with players and with other NPCs.

 Usually, social NPCs in games such as The Legend of Zelda are very limited. Their dialog is hard-coded and they always say the same things. I intend to create NPCs that choose actions based on the context that they find themselves in: their current state of mind, personality, past actions, their memory, recent events, etc. This way, NPCs could refuse talking to a player if said player was rude or punched them.
