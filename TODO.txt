- To deal with 2 agents sending a chat to each other nearly at the same time and ending up speaking very quickly:
--- Make SocialObservations have a method called reactionUrgency() that returns
----- URGENT if the agent should react immediately
----- CAN_WAIT if the agent should put the observation in a queue and react to it later
----- CAN_BE_IGNORED if the agent can ignore the observation if they're currently busy
