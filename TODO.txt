- Add give item action
- Add trade action

- Add farming action
- Add wood chopping action

- Add more observations
--- Characters entering chatting range of agents
---

- Make more things configurable
--- Fishing search radius
---

- More prompt engineering
--- Investigate how fine-tuning could improve agent choices for ChatGPT

- Add compatibility with other models

- Agents module should abstract the NPC logic from EntityUtils so that if necessary it's easier to switch to another NPC plugin
--- MineSocieties should not ever depend on EntityUtils

--- Bugs ---
- Auto-complete for "/agent talk" doesn't work
- NPCs in unloaded chunks will keep making decisions

--- Ideas ---
- To deal with 2 agents sending a chat to each other nearly at the same time and ending up speaking very quickly:
--- Make SocialObservations have a method called reactionUrgency() that returns
----- URGENT if the agent should react immediately
----- CAN_WAIT if the agent should put the observation in a queue and react to it later
----- CAN_BE_IGNORED if the agent can ignore the observation if they're currently busy


--- Future ---
- Possible race conditions when GSON is serializing the AgentState while the main thread modifies it
--- Either have a lock on the AgentState
----- Must encapsulate every single access to its attributes
--- Or make a custom TypeSerializer for AgentState
----- High coupling with AgentState since it must know how to serialize it
