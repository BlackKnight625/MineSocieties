- Add trade action
- Compact agent's inventory everytime a new item is inserted
- Deal with growing short term and long term memories

- Add wood chopping action

- Add more observations
--- Characters entering chatting range of agents
---

- More prompt engineering
--- Investigate how fine-tuning could improve agent choices for ChatGPT

- Add compatibility with other models

- Agents module should abstract the NPC logic from EntityUtils so that if necessary it's easier to switch to another NPC plugin
--- MineSocieties should not ever depend on EntityUtils

--- Bugs ---
- Auto-complete for "/agent talk" doesn't work
- NPCs in unloaded chunks will keep making decisions
- If 2 NPCs have the same name, things can get messy

--- Ideas ---
- To deal with 2 agents sending a chat to each other nearly at the same time and ending up speaking very quickly:
--- Make SocialObservations have a method called reactionUrgency() that returns
----- URGENT if the agent should react immediately
----- CAN_WAIT if the agent should put the observation in a queue and react to it later
----- IGNORE_IF_DECIDING if the agent should ignore the observation if they're querying the LLM on what to do due to something else
----- IGNORE_IF_BUSY if the agent can ignore the observation if they're currently doing an important action
- Make it possible to chat with agents from normal chat when the message references the agent at the start.
--- Ex: "Hey Steve, could you give me some salmon, please?"
--- Could have a regex to detect common greetings and then check if the name is a valid nearby agent name


--- Future ---
- Possible race conditions when GSON is serializing the AgentState while the main thread modifies it
--- Either have a lock on the AgentState
----- Must encapsulate every single access to its attributes
--- Or make a custom TypeSerializer for AgentState
----- High coupling with AgentState since it must know how to serialize it
- End all problems with race conditions by cloning AgentState and passing it to async threads instead of the original object
--- Then, all locks from AgentState's attributes can be removed
--- If changes need to be done to the original, then BukkitRunnables should be created
